Education is simply the soul of a society as it passes from one generation to another. -G. K. Chesterton (1874 - 1936)

Friday was a very intense day for our students in terms of classes, so at the end of the day they had the chance to relax by visiting the Oxford Castle. 

Enjoying nature during lunch time:

And… Oxford Castle…achievement unlocked! 

We learned a little bit about the history of the castle and saw the room where prisoners used to be taken. Thanks to George for being brave enough to volunteer!

In the end our A-team was found guilty of studying too much!
