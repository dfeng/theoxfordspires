Nothing’s better than the wind to your back, the sun in front of you, and your friends beside you. -Aaron Douglas Trimble

Punting has never been so fun! Our A-Team tried punting near St. Catherine’s College today. The weather was in our favor so we took advantage and created a lot of good memories!

A spectacular football match followed right after. Both Team George and Team Revi played a great and fair game. Team George led the first part with a score of 3:0 and won the game with a score of 8:4.
