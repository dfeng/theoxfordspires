We should not teach children the sciences but give them a taste for them. - Jean Jacques Rousseau

The rain today ruined most of all our plans, but we managed to still sell our scones for the Entrepreneurship course. All money raised will be donated to Rosy’s Local Charity. Keep fingers crossed for us!

Preparing scones! Our chefs Louisa and Alex buttering and adding jelly to the scones… yum!
