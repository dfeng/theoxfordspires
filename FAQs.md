## Frequently Asked Questions for Students

**I want to change my core course and/or elective course, is this possible?**
If you wish to change your course selections before the start of the programme, please do not hesitate to contact us. You can still change your course selection up until the Wednesday of the first week. However, changes to courses are always subject to availability. 

**Will I receive a graduation certificate?**
Yes, students will be awarded an Oxford Spires Summer School Graduation Certificate upon satisfactory completion of the course. This will be presented in a graduation ceremony on the final evening of the course.

**When should I arrive for my course?**
The day of arrival is Sunday 03 August 2014. You may arrive any time from 12:00 on the day, though we recommend that you aim to arrive before 17:00, as there is a welcome reception for all new students at this time. When you arrive, you will need to register at the Oxford Spires’ administrative office and sign in. At this point, you will receive your room keys and course information.

**When should I leave at the end of my course?**
Courses will finish on Saturday 16 August 2014 and students should check out and return their keys by 10:00.

**Do I need to attend all classes?**
Yes, attendance is compulsory. You must reach your classes in time and failing to attend or lateness to classes might lead to extra time in the study hall during your free time.

**Will I have to share the room/facilities?**
No, all students will have their own single en-suite bedrooms in St. Catherine’s College.

**Are there laundry facilities on my campus?**
St. Catherine’s College has laundry facilities. Tokens can be purchased from the College lodge or Campus office. Members of our staff are on hand to assist.

**What kind of clothing should I bring?**
Once your place has been confirmed, you will receive a Welcome Pack, which will contain information on what clothes to bring and a list of other packing suggestions.
August is one of the warmest and sunniest months in Oxford. However, it can still sometimes rain quite heavily, so students should remember to pack some warm clothes and waterproof clothing. Recent weather reports and forecasts can be found online at uk.weather.com

**Should I bring a mobile phone?**
Yes, definitely. This will allow family and friends, as well as our staff members to contact you when necessary. However, please note that mobile phones are not permitted in classrooms and lessons.

**Will I have Internet access in my room?**
Yes. Depending on your location the Internet may be wired (requiring an Ethernet cable) or delivered via Wi-Fi. Also, depending on your location you may need to register your computer’s MAC address, an identifier code unique to network adaptors or interface cards (i.e. your laptop).

**Will I have the opportunity to visit other places in the UK during my course?**
The Oxford Spires offers a variety of trips to sites of historical and cultural interest. Further information can be found in the Welcome Pack.

**Do I need to bring money with me, and if so how much?**
We recommend students to bring some cash to cover expenses on food and other emergency purchases made on the day of arrival and departure. 
Please note that there are many banks and ATM (which may charge you for withdrawing money) cash machines around Oxford. Further information can be found in the Welcome Pack. 

**What will my meals be like?**
Breakfast will be served in College every morning, whilst we will make sure to give you the opportunity to sample a variety of cuisines for lunch and dinner. During day-trips, we will provide a packed lunch.
Does the programme accommodate my special dietary requirements?
We are able to cater for any dietary requirements students may have. You will be asked to fill in a form when you receive the Welcome Pack and you must email it back to us at least 30 days before the start date of the programme so that we can cater for your requirements. 
Do I need a visa to travel to the UK?
If you are a EU national, you will not need a visa. For all other nationalities, please go to www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/visas-immigration/do-you-need-a-visa/ to check your requirements. If you do require a visa, we can write a Letter of Invitation to support your application.
