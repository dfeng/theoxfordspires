## Frequently Asked Questions for Students

**I want to change my core course and/or elective course, is this possible?**

If you wish to change your course selections before the start of the programme, please do not hesitate to contact us. You can still change your course selection up until the Wednesday of the first week. However, changes to courses are always subject to availability.

**When should I arrive for my course?**

The day of arrival is Sunday 03 August 2014. You may arrive any time from 12:00 on the day, though we recommend that you aim to arrive before 17:00, as there is a welcome reception for all new students at this time. When you arrive, you will need to register at the Oxford Spires’ administrative office and sign in. At this point, you will receive your room keys and course information.

Courses will finish on Saturday 16 August 2014 and students should check out and return their keys by 10:00.

St. Catherine’s College has laundry facilities. Tokens can be purchased from the College lodge or Campus office. Members of our staff are on hand to assist.

**What kind of clothing should I bring?**

Once your place has been confirmed, you will receive a Welcome Pack, which will contain information on what clothes to bring and a list of other packing suggestions.

August is one of the warmest and sunniest months in Oxford. However, it can still sometimes rain quite heavily, so students should remember to pack some warm clothes and waterproof clothing. Recent weather reports and forecasts can be found online at uk.weather.com

Yes, definitely. This will allow family and friends, as well as our staff members to contact you when necessary. However, please note that mobile phones are not permitted in classrooms and lessons.

**Will I have Internet access in my room?**

Yes. Depending on your location the Internet may be wired (requiring an Ethernet cable) or delivered via Wi-Fi. Also, depending on your location you may need to register your computer’s MAC address, an identifier code unique to network adaptors or interface cards (i.e. your laptop).

**Will I have the opportunity to visit other places in the UK during my course?**

The Oxford Spires offers a variety of trips to sites of historical and cultural interest. Further information can be found in the Welcome Pack.

**Do I need to bring money with me, and if so how much?**

We recommend students to bring some cash to cover expenses on food and other emergency purchases made on the day of arrival and departure. 

Please note that there are many banks and ATM (which may charge you for withdrawing money) cash machines around Oxford. Further information can be found in the Welcome Pack. 

**What will my meals be like?**

Breakfast will be served in College every morning, whilst we will make sure to give you the opportunity to sample a variety of cuisines for lunch and dinner. During day-trips, we will provide a packed lunch.

**Does the programme accommodate my special dietary requirements?**

We are able to cater for any dietary requirements students may have. You will be asked to fill in a form when you receive the Welcome Pack and you must email it back to us at least 30 days before the start date of the programme so that we can cater for your requirements. 

**Do I need a visa to travel to the UK?**

If you are a EU national, you will not need a visa. For all other nationalities, please click [here] (http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/visas-immigration/do-you-need-a-visa/) to check your requirements. If you do require a visa, we can write a Letter of Invitation to support your application.

**What’s the best way to get to the UK (London)?**

The major London airports, Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted and Luton are all conveniently located in relation to Oxford. Oxford is only an hour away on the train and roughly an hour and a half to two hours by bus. Students may also consider flying into Birmingham, as it is only one hour from Oxford by train. 

Alternatively, students can reach London St Pancras Station on the Eurostar. On arrival at London St Pancras, students can take the London Underground (or a taxi) to London Paddington station, from where they can take a direct train to Oxford.

**What’s the best way to get to Oxford?**

Students can either take the train or the ‘Airline’ bus (from Heathrow or Gatwick) from London to Oxford. For further information, please refer to your Welcome Pack. 

**How secure are the campuses?**

Our programme takes place in secure, supervised premises. In addition to our residential staff who can be contacted 24 hours a day, the College entrances are supervised 24 hours a day by college porters. All students under the age of 18 are required to check-in regularly during the day through registers that will be taken at meals, classes and before curfew, which is at 11pm.

There will also be safes on campus where students may deposit valuable items such as passports, travel documents, bank cards and so on.

**Are parents allowed to visit?**

Parents and guardians are invited to attend the welcome reception for new students between 17:00-18:00 on the day of arrival. 

Visits can also be made on weekends when students have free time, but parents and guardians should find out before arriving whether the student will be available on campus or not (as students may be out on day-trips).

**What happens in the case of an accident or an emergency?**
The Oxford Spires has residential staff, and this means that there is someone on site 24 hours a day. In addition, there is a 24-hour emergency phone number on campus, which both students and family/friends may call. This telephone number will be emailed to all students before the start of the programme, and will also be available on our website during the summer.

We also ask that all students under the age of 18 provide the contact details of one parent or guardian.
