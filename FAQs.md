August is one of the warmest and sunniest months in Oxford. However, it can still sometimes rain quite heavily, so students should remember to pack some warm clothes and waterproof clothing. Recent weather reports and forecasts can be found online at uk.weather.com

The Oxford Spires offers a variety of trips to sites of historical and cultural interest. Further information can be found in the Welcome Pack.

**Does the programme accommodate my special dietary requirements?**

We are able to cater for any dietary requirements students may have. You will be asked to fill in a form when you receive the Welcome Pack and you must email it back to us at least 30 days before the start date of the programme so that we can cater for your requirements.

**What’s the best way to get to the UK (London)?**

The major London airports, Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted and Luton are all conveniently located in relation to Oxford. Oxford is only an hour away on the train and roughly an hour and a half to two hours by bus. Students may also consider flying into Birmingham, as it is only one hour from Oxford by train. 

Alternatively, students can reach London St Pancras Station on the Eurostar. On arrival at London St Pancras, students can take the London Underground (or a taxi) to London Paddington station, from where they can take a direct train to Oxford.

**What’s the best way to get to Oxford?**

Students can either take the train or the ‘Airline’ bus (from Heathrow or Gatwick) from London to Oxford. For further information, please refer to your Welcome Pack. 

**How secure are the campuses?**

Our programme takes place in secure, supervised premises. In addition to our residential staff who can be contacted 24 hours a day, the College entrances are supervised 24 hours a day by college porters. All students under the age of 18 are required to check-in regularly during the day through registers that will be taken at meals, classes and before curfew, which is at 11pm.

There will also be safes on campus where students may deposit valuable items such as passports, travel documents, bank cards and so on.

**Are parents allowed to visit?**

Parents and guardians are invited to attend the welcome reception for new students between 17:00-18:00 on the day of arrival. 

Visits can also be made on weekends when students have free time, but parents and guardians should find out before arriving whether the student will be available on campus or not (as students may be out on day-trips).

**What happens in the case of an accident or an emergency?**

The Oxford Spires has residential staff, and this means that there is someone on site 24 hours a day. In addition, there is a 24-hour emergency phone number on campus, which both students and family/friends may call. This telephone number will be emailed to all students before the start of the programme, and will also be available on our website during the summer.

We also ask that all students under the age of 18 provide the contact details of one parent or guardian.
