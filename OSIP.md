title: Oxford Spires Investment Programme
---

The Oxford Spires Investment Programme (OSIP) is designed for students aged 18 and above with an exclusive focus on Value Investments, Economics and Entrepreneurship. Our aim is to provide students with a way of thinking that draws together the most important lessons from these three branches of knowledge. The course is designed to be very practical yet academically rigorous, at the level comparable with top institutions like Oxford and the London School of Economics. During the course students will learn how to open and manage a portfolio, how to analyse a balance sheet, behavioural economics applicable to investment and the importance of execution. By the end of the course, students will have:
- operated a small business in Oxford and generated revenue; and
- extenslively analysed a few stocks and learnt about human biases. 

## Why OSIP?

Here are five reasons why you should join us this summer:

### 1. A unique programme

The programme is one of a kind. It provides a framework to guide your financial decisions by understanding the intertemporal tradeoffs as well as the tradeoffs between different financial instruments and income sources. This is not done from the perspective of economics, finance or business but from a combination of all of them. 

Our programme is designed to give students a taste of the renowned teaching style at Oxford with a combination of lectures and two-to-one weekly tutorials.  

“If you put £1000 into a bank account that gives you 20% every year (compounded) when you turn 20 and you forget about it. How much money would there be in that bank account when you turn 70?” You will be surprised. 

During the course all students and teachers will be equal-shareholders on a £1000 investment. At the end of the summer course we will jointly invest that money in a stock that we have decided on.   

### 2. Getting out of your comfort zone

During the programme students will be challenged to get out of their comfort zones by trying to sell, investing real money and learning the importance of communication as inspired by the work of Dale Carnegie and Warren Buffett.   

### 3. Experienced and enthusiastic teachers

### 4. Invaluable network

Students who participate in the programme come from all corners of the world. This creates a very unique and dynamic environment, which fosters not only a special learning experience, but also long-lasting friendships.

Moreover, as this is an immersion course you also get to meet very closely your teacher and support staff both within a class setting and outside of it.

We hate boring classes so we will make sure all classes are exciting and that you would look forward to them. However, we have also planned many social activities. The Oxford Spires strives to make this summer a fruitful and unforgettable one!
