Students learn to address economic issues faced by countries through applying the analytic framework developed in the course. They also gain the ability to read economic policy literature and follow current economic debates. 

The course starts with 5 lectures on microeconomics, covering individual decision-making, how markets operate through the concepts of supply and demand, and the role of government and taxation. The second part of the course contains 5 lectures on macroeconomics, covering the ways in which the overall economy works, economic growth, inflation, why countries trade with each other and the rationale and impact of government macroeconomic policies.

The Introduction to International Law course provides an overview of the international legal system and examines the key concepts, principles, institutions and debates that shape international law today. Students participate in interactive classes, discussions, debates, group activities and mock trials.

The second part of the course examines a number of topical issues of global concern, including the use of force and the protection of human rights. 

### <a name="3">Entrepreneurship</a>

This is a very hands-on course where students learn about entrepreneurship and how to develop a business idea from scratch. Theory will be presented as a way to help advance students’ business ideas. At the end of the course, students will have a taste of what it practically means to be an entrepreneur, and will understand the challenges and rewards that are involved in the process.

During this course, students master the main concepts of entrepreneurship through attending workshops in Economics, Finance and Venture Capital Funding as well as visiting the Saïd Business School. In the first part of the course, students brainstorm a business idea, learn how to write a business plan, and carry out a SWOT analysis. In the second part of the course, students learn the main concepts of marketing, accounting, negotiation, pitching a business idea and the art of influence. More importantly, students are expected to execute their business idea during the course of the summer school, using the school's start-up funds provided for this purpose. All profits from their venture are donated to the students' preferred Oxford charity.

Several economic models and relevant case studies are presented. In the second part of the course, students carry out an analysis of protectionism and strategic trade barriers to appreciate the repercussions of a country’s trade policies to itself as well as to the global market.
