### <a name="3">The Business Mastermind: Economics and Entrepreneurship</a>

This is a very hands-on course where students learn about entrepreneurship and how to develop a business idea from scratch. Theory will be presented as a way to help advance students’ business ideas. At the end of the course, students will have a taste of what it practically means to be an entrepreneur, and will understand the challenges and rewards that are involved in the process.

In the second part of the course, students learn the main concepts of marketing, accounting, negotiation, pitching a business idea and the art of influence. More importantly, during this time, students execute the business idea. Students take an active role as a social entrepreneur as all profits will go to their preferred local charity in Oxford. In 2014, the students who participated in this course were featured in the local newspaper for their excellent work in raising money for ROSY, a local charity that helps sick youngsters.

It also provides an introduction to the major events since 1890 that have shaped our world to this day.
 
The course commences with an analysis of the structure of the international society to enable students to gain a more in-depth understanding of the nature of contemporary international relations. Students will be introduced to the main theories of international relations including realism, liberalism and constructivism. The course also examines the role of international organisations in international politics such as the League of Nations, the United Nations, the World Bank and the European Union.

### <a name="7">Development Economics</a>

The Development Economics course is an introduction to the study of the economic circumstances and problems of low and middle-income economies. Students learn to better understand a number of specific issues central to the lives of the people who live in the developing world.
 
In the first part of the course, we inquire about economic development and consider the contributions economic analysis can make to explaining why some nations are poor and others are rich as well as what determines economic growth. Students review alternative theories of economic growth and discuss inequality and poverty from a global perspective. 
In the second part of the course, students will learn about the policies which are particularly successful at increasing school enrollment rates, vaccination rates, gender equality etc. We will discuss the importance of randomised controlled trials in obtaining good estimates of the impact of different policies. We will also study to what extent households can benefit from a greater access to microcredit and microfinance in general.

### <a name="8">International Trade and Economic Policy </a>

The International Economic Policy course focuses on international trade in goods, services, and capital. It serves as an introduction to international economic issues. Students evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of global economic interdependence through trade and policy.
 
In the first part of the course, students examine the big questions: (i) why do countries trade, (ii) what determines the patterns of trade, and (iii) how are the gains from trade distributed. Several economic models and relevant case studies are presented. In the second part of the course, students carry out an analysis of protectionism and strategic trade barriers to appreciate the repercussions of a country’s trade policies to itself as well as to the global market.

### <a name="9">The Art of Acting and Communication</a>

The Art of Acting and Communication is a course designed to help students to understand and control their presence and voice on stage. It will also allow them to open, explore and expand the use of their imagination. This course is designed to help students gain confidence and provide them with the necessary tools they will need whenever acting on stage, during interviews or speaking in public.

In order to express their opinions and point of views correctly, students will learn how to connect their thoughts and emotions through the use of their bodies. During class, we will be working on different relaxation and breathing techniques, movement, expression and voice exercises, which will allow students to use their bodies without harming themselves and to communicate better to their audiences.

We will be working with different types of texts and the course will finish with a little showcase of our work.
