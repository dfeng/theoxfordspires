They also gain the ability to read economic policy literature and follow current economic debates. 

The course starts with 5 lectures on microeconomics, covering individual decision-making, how markets operate through the concepts of supply and demand, and the role of government and taxation. The second part of the course contains 5 lectures on macroeconomics, covering the ways in which the overall economy works, economic growth, inflation, why countries trade with each other and the rationale and impact of government macroeconomic policies. 

### <a name="2">Introduction to Law</a>

The Introduction to Law course is designed to provide an overview of the institutions, personnel and procedures of the English Legal System and the international legal system. Students participate in interactive classes, discussions, debates, group activities and mock trials.
 
The course begins with a brief analysis of the history of the English Legal System and the different sources of law.

### <a name="3">The Business Mastermind: Economics and Entrepreneurship</a>

This is a very hands-on course where students learn about entrepreneurship and how to develop a business idea from scratch. Theory will be presented as a way to help advance students’ business ideas. At the end of the course, students will have a taste of what it practically means to be an entrepreneur, and will understand the challenges and rewards that are involved in the process.
 
During this course, students master the important concepts in economics that every business person must understand. In the first part of the course, students brainstorm a business idea and learn how to write a business plan. In the second part of the course, students learn the main concepts of marketing, accounting, negotiation, pitching a business idea and the art of influence. More importantly, during this time, students execute the business idea. Students take an active role as a social entrepreneur as all profits will go to their preferred local charity in Oxford. In 2014, the students who participated in this course were featured in the local newspaper for their excellent work in raising money for ROSY, a local charity that helps sick youngsters.
